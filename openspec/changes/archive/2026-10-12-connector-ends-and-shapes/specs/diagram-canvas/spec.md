## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Property inspector
The inspector SHALL begin with the style strip (swatches, picker, inherit, line, width, route, corners, start and end heads, effects and speed, and the theme row for the diagram) and SHALL then show the fields of the diagram when nothing is selected, of one element, of one relation, or the style fields shared by several selected items:

- **diagram**: title, description, direction, layout, routing, theme, preset;
- **element**: id, kind, label, description, classes, ports, position, size and every style property;
- **relation**: id, label, ends and ports, line (solid, dashed or dotted), routing, corners, start and end heads, classes, style properties and label position.

Each change SHALL be one edit plan: `setDiagramProperty`, `setStyleProperty`, `setElementLabel`, `setDescription`, `setElementKind`, `setRelationLine`, `setClasses`, `addPort`, `removePort`, `setPosition`, `setSize` or `setRoute`; a change to several selected items SHALL be one batch plan. Fields SHALL show the written value or, greyed, the default.

#### Scenario: Change a colour shared by a style
- **WHEN** `style api, db { fill "#eef" }` exists and the inspector sets the fill of `api` to `accent`
- **THEN** the statement becomes `style db { fill "#eef" }` and `style api { fill accent }` is added

#### Scenario: Width for a selection
- **WHEN** `api` and `db` are selected and the strip sets the width to 2
- **THEN** one undo step gives both `width 2`
